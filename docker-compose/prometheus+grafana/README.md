# Prometheus and Grafana Docker Compose Setup

This Docker Compose configuration sets up a monitoring stack with Prometheus and Grafana. Prometheus collects and stores monitoring data, while Grafana provides a web-based interface for visualizing that data.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed on your system.
- **Docker Compose**: Make sure Docker Compose is installed and accessible.

## Getting Started

To start the Prometheus and Grafana services, use the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
