This has been asked several times so I'll list the steps to undo autologin
If you don't set a root password first, you will not be able to login to the container again, ever.

set the root password sudo passwd root

remove --autologin root from /etc/systemd/system/container-getty@1.service.d/override.conf

reboot

ðŸ”„ Bonus Tip:
If you have scripts or muscle memory with docker-compose, you can create a quick alias:

bash
Copy
Edit
echo 'alias docker-compose="docker compose"' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
