### Problem

For a case where the path involves the use of white space characters, for example, when I need to access the app xyz which location is :

```bash
C:\Program Files\ab cd\xyz.exe
```

To run this from windows cmd prompt, you need to use

```bash
C:\"Program Files"\"ab cd"\xyz.exe
```

or

```bash
"C:\Program Files\ab cd\xyz.exe"
```
